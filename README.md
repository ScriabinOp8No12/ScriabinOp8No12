### Hi I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

<h1>I'm a Programmer, Pianist, Go/Baduk teacher, and Entrepreneur!</h1>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Go website
- ðŸŒ± You'll likely find me programming, teaching Go or piano, practicing piano, watching anime, playing tennis, or hanging out with my family and close friends
- âš¡ Fun fact 1: I performed a piano concerto in front of over 1000 people when I was 12 years old (yes, it was SCARY!!!)
- âš¡ Fun fact 2: I started a boba company while in college, developing my own handmade boba recipe, and sold over 1000 cups of boba tea at the Boulder Farmers Market and Creek Festival in 7 days
- âš¡ Fun fact 3: I achieved a "Grandmaster" equivalent rating in Go/Baduk when I was 15 years old, and I've been volunteering by teaching for the last 14 years at the same Go club where I first learned
